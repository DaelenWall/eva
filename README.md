# Introducing: EVA

EVA (Emotional Variance Assistant) is a web-based assessment that evaluates a subject’s alignment with an institutional definition of emotional stability.

All further explanation is intentionally vague.

The assessment does not attempt to determine how a subject feels.
It evaluates how a subject behaves, responds, and defaults when placed in ordinary situations.

EVA assumes that:

Predictable emotional states are preferable to expressive ones

Consistency is more valuable than intensity

Emotional variance introduces interpretability risk

A stable subject is easier to understand, support, and retain


# How EVA Works

Subjects are presented with a sequence of short, approachable scenarios involving mascots (e.g. Jerry, Milo, Sunny).

Each scenario is intentionally mundane.

Nothing is framed as a test.

Each question offers four responses, ordered from:

A — most aligned

D — least aligned
